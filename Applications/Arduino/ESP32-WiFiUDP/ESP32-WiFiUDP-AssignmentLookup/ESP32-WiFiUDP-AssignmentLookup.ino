/*
  This sketch overrides Ose's default assignment function, extending it to 
  allow us to "assign" a value to a pin. Similarly, we substitute our own
  lookup function that can "lookup" pin values.
  
  We follow the same conventions as OSCuino (https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC),
  as we did in the sketch ESP-WiFiUDP-AddressServer.ino, where /d/<n> refers
  to digital pin <n>, and /a/<n> refers to analog pin <n>. 

  In this example, though, we will use the Ose prefixes for assignment and 
  lookup: /@ and /$. Since we don't have an analogWrite function for the 
  ESP32, we will only read ("lookup") from the analog pins.

  Unlike ESP32-WiFiUDP-AddressServer.ino, when we do a lookup here, the value
  of the pin will be placed on the stack, just like Ose's normal behavior.
  That way, it will be available for further processing by other messages
  we might send. If we want the value to be sent back to us, we'll have to
  explicitly put it in the output bundle (see the Max / PD patches).

  Examples:
	/@/d/* 			set all digital pins to the value on the stack
	/@/d/{25,26} : 0	set digital pins 25 and 26 to LOW
	/$/a/[79]		push the values of analog pins 7 and 9 onto the stack
